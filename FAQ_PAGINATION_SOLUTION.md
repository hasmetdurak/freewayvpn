# FAQ Pagination Solution

## Problem
The website was only displaying a limited number of FAQs (around 20) for languages that have many FAQs (like Japanese with over 1000 FAQs). This was causing users to miss most of the available content.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Translation System
- Updated the LanguageContext to support parameterized translations
- Added support for replacing placeholders like `{count}` and `{total}` in translation strings
- Added pagination translation keys for multiple languages

### 2. FAQ Page Pagination
- Implemented pagination in the FAQPage component
- Set page size to 50 FAQs per page
- Added navigation controls with Previous/Next buttons
- Implemented smart page numbering that shows:
  - First and last page numbers
  - Current page and nearby pages (Â±2 pages)
  - Ellipsis for skipped page ranges
- Added "Showing X of Y results" display
- Added smooth scrolling to top when changing pages

### 3. Performance Improvements
- Pagination reduces initial render load by only displaying 50 FAQs at a time
- Better memory usage and rendering performance
- Improved user experience with faster page loads

### 4. Multi-language Support
- Added pagination translations for 6 languages:
  - English
  - Japanese
  - Korean
  - German
  - Spanish
  - French
  - Portuguese
- More languages can be added easily

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. `src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx` - Enhanced translation function with parameter support
2. `src/pages/FAQPage.tsx` - Implemented pagination logic and UI
3. `src/utils/translations.ts` - Added pagination translation keys

### Key Features:
- **Smart Pagination**: Only shows relevant page numbers to avoid clutter
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering with virtualized lists
- **User Experience**: Smooth scrolling and clear navigation

## Benefits

1. **Complete Content Access**: Users can now access all FAQs, not just the first 20
2. **Better Performance**: Pages load faster with fewer DOM elements
3. **Improved UX**: Clear navigation and progress indication
4. **Scalable**: Works with any number of FAQs
5. **Multi-language**: Supports all website languages

## Testing

The solution has been tested with:
- Japanese FAQs (1000+ entries)
- English FAQs (20+ entries)
- German FAQs (17 entries)
- All pagination controls work correctly
- Search and filtering still function properly
- Page resets correctly when changing languages or filters

## Future Improvements

1. **Infinite Scroll**: Could implement infinite scrolling as an alternative to pagination
2. **Category-based Pagination**: Separate pagination per category
3. **Search Result Highlighting**: Highlight search terms in FAQ questions
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add keyboard navigation for pagination
5. **AJAX Loading**: Load FAQs asynchronously for even better performance

This solution ensures that all FAQs are accessible to users while maintaining good performance and user experience.
