## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Content Localization Utility
The `contentLocalization.ts` utility handles all language-specific content loading:

1. **FAQ Loading**:
   - Dynamically loads language-specific FAQ files
   - Handles German FAQs from multiple JSON files
   - Provides fallback to English for unsupported languages

2. **Blog Loading**:
   - Filters blog posts by language-specific criteria
   - Loads dedicated content for each language
   - Applies translations where available

3. **Search Filtering**:
   - Filters content based on search terms within the selected language

### Page Implementation
- **FAQPage.tsx**: Uses the content localization utility to load only language-specific FAQs
- **BlogPage.tsx**: Uses the content localization utility to load only language-specific blog posts
