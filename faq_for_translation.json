    {"id": 112, "question": "Why should someone use a VPN for everyday browsing?", "answer": "Using a VPN for daily browsing enhances your online privacy and security. It encrypts your internet traffic, preventing ISPs, advertisers, or hackers from monitoring your activities. This is especially crucial on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi in cafes or airports, where data theft is a risk. A VPN also lets you bypass geo-restrictions, accessing content like region-locked YouTube videos or news sites. For example, you can browse anonymously, shop for cheaper flights, or stream international TV shows. In 2025, with data breaches on the rise, a VPN adds a layer of protection. ExpressVPN, known for its speed and reliability, is a great option for seamless browsing across devices. Its intuitive interface suits all users.", "category": "General VPN Info"},
    {"id": 114, "question": "How does a VPN improve online security for beginners?", "answer": "For beginners, a VPN simplifies online security by encrypting your internet connection, which protects sensitive data like passwords or credit card details from hackers. It masks your IP address, making it harder for websites or trackers to identify you. This is especially useful on public Wi-Fi, where cyberattacks are common. A VPN also blocks intrusive ads and trackers, creating a smoother browsing experience. In 2025, with cybercrime costing billions annually, even casual users benefit from this protection. CyberGhost offers an easy-to-use interface with pre-configured security settings, ideal for newcomers. Its no-logs policy ensures your data stays private. By exploring options like CyberGhost, you can start securing your online activities without technical expertise.", "category": "General VPN Info"},
    {"id": 115, "question": "What's the difference between a VPN and a proxy server?", "answer": "A VPN and a proxy server both mask your IP address, but they differ significantly. A VPN encrypts all your internet traffic, routing it through a secure server, ensuring privacy and security across apps and websites. Proxies only redirect specific traffic (e.g., browser data) without encryption, leaving you vulnerable to snooping. VPNs are ideal for sensitive tasks like banking or bypassing geo-restrictions, while proxies are better for quick, non-sensitive access to blocked sites. For example, a VPN lets you stream Netflix securely, while a proxy might not. PureVPN provides affordable, encrypted connections with servers in 70+ countries, making it a stronger choice than proxies.", "category": "General VPN Info"},
    {"id": 116, "question": "Can a VPN hide my browsing history from my ISP?", "answer": "Yes, a VPN hides your browsing history from your ISP by encrypting your traffic and routing it through a remote server. This prevents your ISP from seeing which websites you visit or what you do online, protecting your privacy. For instance, if you're streaming or researching sensitive topics, a VPN keeps your activity private. In 2025, with ISPs increasingly monetizing user data, this is a key benefit. NordVPN, with its audited no-logs policy, ensures even the VPN provider can't see your activity. Its 5,500+ servers offer flexibility for private browsing. By choosing a service like NordVPN, you can maintain control over your digital footprint and browse worry-free.", "category": "General VPN Info"},
    {"id": 117, "question": "Do I need a VPN when using my home Wi-Fi?", "answer": "While home Wi-Fi is generally safer than public networks, a VPN still adds valuable protection. It encrypts your data, preventing hackers from exploiting weak router security or intercepting sensitive information like login credentials. It also stops ISPs from tracking your browsing habits for targeted ads. For example, if you shop online or manage finances at home, a VPN ensures your data stays secure. Additionally, it unlocks geo-restricted content like international streaming platforms. ExpressVPN offers fast, reliable connections for home use, with apps for routers and devices. Its user-friendly setup makes it easy to secure your entire network.", "category": "General VPN Info"}
